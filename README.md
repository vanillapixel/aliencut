[_Live Website_](https://www.aliencut.com/)

### Strategy

A one-page website displaying the most essential info about the djs events, merch and contacts.
The client hasn't shown interests to self-maintain the content on the website, discouraging proposed further development of the website like adding events details (picture of the location, link to fb/external website events/picture of the brochure)

The website serves the main purpose to attract events organizers and location owners to further contact by displaying concise information of their previous bookings, images of the extra standard services provided such as sax and percussions live perfomances,

### Coding

I decided _not_ to use any 3rd party libraries as the project was intended to be a test ground to learn creating highly customized functionalities and to push myself to learn whatever happens behind the scenes of libraries methods.
