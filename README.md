- column selectors have an after pseudo element to extend their clickable area (to improve UX)

==========================================================

## Strategy

A one-page website displaying the most essential info about the djs events, merch and contacts.
The client hasn't shown interests to self-maintain the content of the website, discouraging proposed further development like adding events details (picture of the location, link to fb/external website events/picture of the flyer)

The website serves the main purpose to attract events organizers and location owners to further continformationact by displaying concise of their previous bookings, images of the extra standard services provided such as sax and percussions live perfomances.
